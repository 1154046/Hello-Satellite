# Exposing Machine Learning Web Services on IBM Cloud Satellite

In this code pattern, we will learn how to create a machine learning web service / batch process using CP4D hosted on RedHat OpenShift running on IBM Satellite.

## IBM CP4D

## IBM Satellite



When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Setup IBM Cloud Satellite Location
* Setup IBM Cloud OpenShift on Satellite
* Create a CP4D project
* Add custom data into your project
* Gain insights from your data
* Create AI models from your data
* Create a web service / batch process from the model
* Expose the web service to different technology stacks
